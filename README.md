# An Implementation of Outside-In Tracking Using a PS Move-Like Method For VR Applications

This project uses multiple cameras (PS3 Eye cameras) to preform outside-in tracking of custom DIY PS Move-Like trackers in 3D space that can be used for VR applications.
The trackers are based on the ESP-01 board paired with an 6 or preferably 9-axis IMU over I2C. GPIO 3 of the ESP-01 is connected to a single WS2812B LED that has been placed inside a ping pong ball to form the tracker. The schematics of the tracker will be added.
